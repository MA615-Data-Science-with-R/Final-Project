The Shiny app is in the Finalr. R file
The report is in Finalrpdf.pdf also in Finalrpdf.html
The presentation is in Finalrpresentation.pdf
The others are all the datasets used in the projects.
There is also a file that is a pdf that consists of all the screenshots showcasing the working of the app



For me to publish it, i kept getting an error-

I keep getting this error-
── Preparing for deployment ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✔ Deploying "finalr" using "server: shinyapps.io / username: nikhitam"
Error in quartoInspect():
! Failed to run quarto inspect against your content:
ERROR: /Users/nikhitamantravadi/Desktop/FinalR/datacleaning.R is not a valid Quarto input document


So to publish it, i put my code in a .rmd file and ran it in a seperate folder on my laptop.
But due to this, the images are not showing up on the file i published.
Link to my shinyapps.io-
